# Townsmen 3 Remaster
Townsmen 3 Remaster is a recreation of the old mobile (J2ME) economical real-time strategy game. 

## General
The gameplay is all about controlling the town and taking care of its economy. Player acts as the town major and his duty is to control the town by producing enough resources to both trade and keep townies wealthy and happy. Resources are either mined from the surrounding area (wood from forests, stones from mountains, fish from ocean etc) or made out of the other resources (lumber out of wood, tools out of iron etc). All jobs are made by townies but in order for them to produce particular resources Player must build structures.

## Game modes
The game has two modes – campaign and endless mode. 
Campaign consists of 14 missions which are unlocked one by one upon their completion. Each campaign mission has its own tasks that must be completed for winning and unlocking the next mission. A lot of tasks are limited in time (ingame Days). 
Endless mode is unlocked after finishing the last mission of campaign. This mode has no primary tasks or time limits and Player is free to develop his town in the way he wants to.

## Plot
Campaign missions are connected by plot. According to it, Player represents the leader of a new Colony on the newfound continent (most likely North America). At first, colonists (aka Townies) lead by Colony leader claim new grounds and develop the Town while also maintaining connection with The Old World by trading. Aside of that, Townies meet the Native people and the relations between them are determined by Player's actions ingame. But later on, after founding new trade goods like Rum and Tobacco which quickly became highly popular and demanded at The Old World, Townies are forced to work hard and ship lots of trading goods back to the metropolis. All Colony habitants are very unhappy about such living and yearn for liberation. Eventually, Colony declares a war for independence to The Old World and the Player becomes The Predisent of the newfound state. It's up to him to ensure the Townies will have all the required resources as well as the strong army to provide the victory of the war and happy life in peace from then on.

## Controls
The game has two primary screens – the terrain view and the detailed view. 
The terrain view shows the whole map of the level. The map is divided in square pieces shown isometrically. Each terrain piece represents a structure, a resource source (e.g. mountain, forest) or an empty area which can be used for placing a new structure. Player can move a yellow square that highligts the terrain piece allowing to see the status of terrain piece and to open its own detailed view.
The detailed view allows to control the chosen terrain piece. It shows the chosen piece in a larger scale, some details of it and provides a horizontal menu of buttons which can be used for controlling. Most of the menu elements depend on the kind of chosen terrain piece. Choosing the "Mountain" terrain piece will allow nothing but viewing the details. The "Grass" terrain piece can be used for building a new structure. And if Player will choose the structure the menu will have options for viewing the building's upkeep, upgrading or downgrading it and changing its production. There will be also some menu options that are shown only in particular cases. The menu of the "Harbor" (the main structure) will provide the trading submenu only when the trading ship is in the bay. The menu of the "Village" will provide different goods eligible for trading depending on the Player's reputation (aka "Attitude"). Some terrain pieces can be occupied by enemies – they can't be controlled in the usual way but it is possible to fight the enemy if Player has at least one Fort with forces in it.
Also there are several additional screens – the Stock screen (shows current amount of each resource) and Upkeep screen (shows total upkeep for all enabled structures).

## Resources
All level resources can be divided into Stock resources, Gold, Attitude and Time. 
Stock resources are produced by various buildings, bought from the trading ships and traded with the Natives. Each of these resources is limited to 20, 50 or 99 units according to the Harbor level (1, 2 or 3 respectfully).
Gold is used for trading just as Stock resources. However, unlike Stock resources, Gold can't be produced by buildings and is unlimited.
Attitude works as a reputation indicator and determines the relationship between Townies and Natives. Trading with the Natives and giving them gifts increases the Attitude. Attacking Natives' territories decreases the Attitude. Low Attitude makes Natives occupy the territory and prevent Player from controlling or using it. High Attitude unlocks new trading possibilities with Natives and motivates Natives to build Temples, which will increase the resource production efficiency. Shipyard is affected by Attitude as well: low Attitude allows to send pirate ships into raids and high Attitude allows to send trading ships for trading.
Time resource is shown as day count. One day passes after another, like in real life. Each 10 days some amount of Stock resources is taken as upkeep for maintaining the work of the buildings. Trading ships periodically come and stay in Harbor for 5 days. Some mission objectives in campaign are time-limited which means they must be done in certain amount of days. Player has only one way to affect the Time – by using the "fast-forward" function. It leaps the game to 5 days into the future.

Structures
Harbor. The harbor is the main building and it cannot be demolished. All resources have to be brought here before they can be sold to a merchant ship. All building and upkeep costs are automatically taken from the harbor storage. Besides, the harbor is able to employ a fisherman to catch fish from the sea.
Forester. Harvests wood in the forest or cuts the wood into handy pieces of lumber.
Farm. Produces sugarcane, tobacco or cute little piggies for meat production.
Mine. Mines for water, stone and iron in the mountains.
Smithy. Produces tools, weapons or cannons.
Distillery. Produces Rum.
Fort. Recruits soldiers.
Shipyard. Builds merchant or pirate ships.
Village. Here you can trade resources with the natives or send them gifts to gain their favor.
Temple. Is constructed in your honor by the natives. It influences the production of a specific resource in a positive way.
